<<<<<<< HEAD
I messed up here. I meant to make an identical branch that is started locally.
I should've been in the master branch first, but, instead, this branch is in the 
test-branch-2. #facepalm.
=======
"Hello Git World"
"Hello World"
"Chocolate is Life"
"Coffee is The Sweet Nectar"
"my-test-branch"
"my second test branch"
        I branched from Bash and it wouldn't let me push to github.
        Then, I created test-branch-2 From github, which exists now.
